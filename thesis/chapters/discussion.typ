  //  DISCUSSION CHAPTER - WRITING GUIDE (paragraph by paragraph)

  //  P1. Summary of key findings
  //       - Briefly recap the most important quantitative or qualitative outcomes
  //         of your evaluation (no new numbers, just a high-level summary).
  //       - Example (hardware):
  //             "Our evaluation showed that the posit-8 format consistently delivers
  //              the highest clock frequency and lowest LUT usage across DSP kernels,
  //              while posit-16 offers a modest accuracy improvement with a small
  //              area overhead."
  //       - Example (software):
  //             "The software evaluation revealed that posit-16 provides the best
  //              balance of numerical error, runtime, and energy consumption for
  //              the climate-advection and n-body kernels, whereas the unum-like
  //              format excels for the LU-decomposition kernel where dynamic range
  //              is critical."

  //  P2. Interpretation of results
  //       - Explain why you observed those outcomes, linking them to the underlying
  //         characteristics of the number representations (precision, range,
  //         encoding efficiency, etc.).
  //       - Example (hardware):
  //             "Posit-8's tapered accuracy and compact encoding reduce the amount
  //              of logic needed for arithmetic, whereas posit-16's larger fraction
  //              gives an extra bit of precision without a proportional increase
  //              in routing complexity."
  //       - Example (software):
  //             "Posit-16's use-of-regime encoding yields efficient representation
  //              of numbers near unity, which are common in scientific kernels,
  //              while the unum-like format's variable-size exponent avoids
  //              overflow/underflow in the LU decomposition's large intermediate
  //              values."

  //  P3. Comparison with existing work
  //       - Relate your findings to the related work discussed in the background
  //         chapter: do you confirm, extend, or contradict previous claims?
  //       - Example (hardware):
  //             "These results agree with earlier FloPoCo studies that posit-8
  //              achieves lower area than IEEE-754 for low-precision DSP[web:119],
  //              and they extend the observation to a broader set of kernels and
  //              to the posit-16 format."
  //       - Example (software):
  //             "Our findings corroborate recent HPC work that posit-based
  //              arithmetic can reduce time-to-solution in turbulent-flow
  //              simulations[web:121], and they add the insight that a CI-integrated
  //              library makes such experiments repeatable across large teams."

  //  P4. Implications for the domain
  //       - Discuss how the results affect practitioners or researchers in your
  //         broader domain (e.g., hardware designers, scientific-computing teams).
  //       - Example (hardware):
  //             "For hardware accelerators, the data suggest that posit-8 should be
  //              the default choice for throughput-oriented DSP blocks, while
  //              posit-16 is worth considering when a few extra LUTs are available
  //              and higher fidelity is needed."
  //       - Example (software):
  //             "Scientific-computing teams can now plug the number-representation
  //              library into their Jenkins pipelines and instantly see the
  //              trade-off between precision, runtime, and energy, enabling
  //              data-driven format selection for climate-modeling, n-body
  //              simulations, or linear-algebra workloads."

  //  P5. Limitations
  //       - Identify any threats to validity, assumptions, or constraints that
  //         could affect the generalizability of your results.
  //       - Example (hardware):
  //             "Our synthesis targets a single Artix-7 FPGA; results may differ on
  //              newer Ultrascale+ or ASIC technologies. The power numbers are
  //              estimates from XPE, not measured on silicon."
  //       - Example (software):
  //             "Benchmark kernels are synthetic proxies; real scientific
  //              applications may involve different memory access patterns or
  //              mixed-precision workflows that could shift the trade-offs."

  //  P6. Future work
  //       - Propose concrete, feasible extensions that build on your thesis
  //         (e.g., new formats, larger benchmarks, hardware-software co-design).
  //       - Example (hardware):
  //             "Future work could integrate the library into a full SoC with a
  //              RISC-V core, explore posit-32 for higher-dynamic-range kernels,
  //              and automate power measurement via on-chip sensors."
  //       - Example (software):
  //             "Future work could add support for stochastic rounding, extend the
  //              benchmark suite to include machine-learning inference kernels,
  //              and provide a GitHub Action template for broader CI adoption."
